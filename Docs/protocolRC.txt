📝 Final ReactCraft Project Protocol (V 2.4)

Version: 2.4 (Last Updated: November 7, 2025)

Purpose: To guide project development with clear, industry-standard practices, maintain consistency, and document all key architectural decisions.

1. 🛑 Non-Deviation Mandate (Standard Enforcement)

This protocol represents the mandatory standard of professional practice for the ReactCraft project. No code, structural decision, or architectural change shall be merged that deviates from the rules outlined below. In case of conflicting external advice, this document serves as the single source of truth for all development standards.
All work must pass automated quality checks (Linting, Formatting) and adhere to the Mobile-First strategy.

2. 🛠️ Technology Stack

Component

Standard

Notes

Frontend

React, Vite

Modern, high-performance tooling.

Styling

CSS Modules, CSS Custom Properties

Scoped styling for reusability; global variables for robust theming.

Backend (Future)

Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Standardized MERN stack for scalable full-stack development.

3. 📱 Responsive Design Strategy: Mobile-First Standard

The project's architecture is based on Progressive Enhancement, starting with the smallest screen and scaling up. This is a mandatory professional standard.

Rule

Implementation Standard

Viewport Meta Tag

The public/index.html file MUST include the standard meta tag: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">.

Base Styling

All initial CSS must target the narrowest viewport (mobile), containing only the essential layout and styles.

Media Queries

MUST exclusively use min-width queries to progressively add complexity for larger screens (e.g., @media (min-width: 768px)). max-width queries are prohibited for main layout adaptation.

Accessibility (A11y)

Development MUST prioritize Semantic HTML (using <header>, <nav>, <main>, etc.) and adhere to ARIA compliance to ensure screen reader compatibility.

4. 📝 Code Standards & Architecture

Area

Rule / Standard

File Naming

PascalCase.jsx for all React components. camelCase.js for all pure JavaScript files (hooks, utilities, services).

Component Architecture

The project uses a Component-Centric Architecture following the principle of Colocation. Every component resides in its own dedicated subdirectory folder.

Component Entry Point (Barrel Pattern)

For all component directories, the folder MUST expose the component via a simple "Barrel Export" file named index.js. The main component file must retain its descriptive name (e.g., ProjectCard.jsx) for developer clarity.

Styling Location

Global (src/index.css): Reserved only for CSS resets, fonts, and global variables. Component-Specific: All styles must use .module.css for strict scoping.

Component Type

All components MUST be written as Functional Components utilizing React Hooks for state and logic.

5. ✅ Professional Quality Enforcement

Standard

Tool / Action

Rationale

Code Quality

ESLint (e.g., using Airbnb config) and Prettier.

Enforces consistent structure and auto-formats code to save time and reduce style-related review comments.

Enforcement

Linting and formatting MUST be integrated via a pre-commit hook (e.g., Husky) or in the CI/CD pipeline. No code is committed unless it passes linting.

Prevents sub-standard code from entering the repository.

Verification

All new custom hooks, utility functions, and complex logic MUST be covered by Unit Tests (e.g., using Vitest/Jest and React Testing Library).

Prevents regressions (bugs) and ensures long-term stability.

6. 🚀 Compliant Project Path Map (V 2.4 Example)

The following structure is mandatory, reflecting the Barrel Export pattern:

portfolio2023-main/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── App.module.css
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── About/
│   │   │   ├── index.js             <-- BARREL ENTRY POINT
│   │   │   ├── About.jsx            <-- DESCRIPTIVELY NAMED COMPONENT
│   │   │   └── About.module.css
│   │   ├── Water/
│   │   │   ├── index.js             <-- BARREL ENTRY POINT: exports { default } from './Video'
│   │   │   ├── Video.jsx            <-- Component Logic (per user structure)
│   │   │   └── Water.module.css
│   │   ├── ProjectCard/
│   │   │   ├── index.js
│   │   │   ├── ProjectCard.jsx
│   │   │   └── ProjectCard.module.css
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useTheme.js
│   └── index.css


7. 🏷️ Professional Commit Standard: Conventional Commits

All Git commit messages MUST adhere to the Conventional Commits Specification. This standard ensures a readable, searchable, and automatically parsable project history, which is mandatory for professional software engineering.

📝 Mandatory Commit Message Structure

Commit messages must use the following structure: type(scope): description

Key Types and Explanation

Type

Purpose

Short Explanation

feat

Features/Enhancements

Used when adding a new capability, component, or enhancement. (e.g., feat(ui): Add mobile navigation menu)

fix

Bug Fixes

Used for all code changes that correct a defect or unexpected behavior.

refactor

Code Restructuring

Used for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, but improve code structure, quality, or readability.

chore

Maintenance

Used for routine tasks, dependency updates, and minor build/tooling changes. (e.g., chore(deps): Update Prettier version)

style

Formatting

Used for changes that only affect code style (whitespace, semicolons, missing semicolons, etc.) and not logic.

docs

Documentation

Used for changes solely related to documentation, like READMEs or protocol updates.

test

Testing

Used when adding or correcting unit tests or integration tests.
